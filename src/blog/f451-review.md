## My Thoughts on Fahrenheit 451

It was a pleasure to burn (through this book).

### Background

When I first bought my brother this book way back in 2023, he said he didn't understand a single thing upon reading the first few pages. Obviously, I got intimidated but curious, but never got around to read it until I obtained another copy from my senior who was packing his stuff at the end of his scholarship journey. I started reading it during my flight from Vietnam to Singapore in January 2026. The two-hour flight enabled me to finish about half the book, which was crazy at that point.

<br>

Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury, set in a far future American society where books are banned by law and mass media control every aspects of the populace. Guy Montag, the protagonist, is a fireman. Not the typical fireman we all know and love &mdash; his job was to set houses on fire instead of saving them from it. Montag is disillusioned into thinking books are "useless" and saught to destroy them as soon as possible. In the story, he meets a young teenager who opens his eyes to the world, causing him to question his own happiness. This dilemma eventually caused him to start preserving books in his house, leading to an epic ending (which I am not going to spoil).

### Drawing Parallels

Upon learning about Fahrenheit 451's dystopian society, I cannot help but compare it to our own society we live in right now in 2026. The author painted a world where people, including the protagonist's wife, Mildred, are constantly stimulated and addicted to their "parlour walls". In the book, Montag and his wife struggled to remember when and where they first met, revealing their indifference and emotional detachment from each other. This is much reflected in our current society. Relationships are formed quickly but dissolved just as fast. Constant stimulation and distractions from mobile phones leave little room for emotional intimacy and deep conversations. For many young people, significant others are often reduced to conduits for Instagram attention rather than genuine connections. In a world where online attention matters more than physical presence, has the digital facade displace our room for authentic thoughts and emotional peace?

In Ray Bradbury's world, cars frequently travel at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. Clarisse McClellan notes that drivers go so fast they don't even notice the grass and flowers on the side road, appearing to them as only "blurs". This closely resembles the "dopamine rush" we experience nowadays, especially in a fast-paced society like Singapore. In MRT stations, people rush their steps to their next destination. In schools, students race towards their next lessons. In HDB flats, people mind their own businesses and rarely interact with neighbours. In a culture that prioritises the destination over the journey, we have become so fixated on the major milestones rather than the process of achieving them.

<br>

Do we still know how to feel bored? In a world full of TikToks, Instagram Reels and Youtube Shorts, we are bombarded with entertainment every waking minute of our lives, while our brains are not allowed to take rests. This "doomscrolling" phenomenon appropriately mirrors the mindless consumption of media portrayed in Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury's Mildred serves as a character whose thinking abilities got destroyed by constant stimulations from the "Seashells" (AirPods) to the "family in the parlour walls" (screens). This not only created an emotional barrier between her and her husband but also took away her critical perception of the world. And when the stimulation stops (when Montag forced her to read books with him), her consciousness is utterly destroyed with an emptiness they don't know how to handle. An observant critic would point out how MRT rides nowadays are filled with people scrolling or gaming on their phones when in the past, it would be a communal space for people-watching, reading physical newspaper or simply letting one's mind wander aimlessly.


### Conclusion

Of course, all the statements above are merely my thoughts, not critics. In an ever-evolving society, we must be mindful of our use of digital entertainment. If we continue to prioritise the "blur" brought about by the dopamine rush from scrolling, we may find ourselves like Mildred, standing in a room with so much noise yet so much emptiness.

Maybe it was the damn phone all along.
